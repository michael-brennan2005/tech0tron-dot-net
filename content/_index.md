Welcome to my little slice of the internet, I'm Michael Brennan!

I'm a rising 2nd year at Northeastern University studying computer engineering & computer science. My interests are in backend development, graphics and GPU programming, and embedded systems.

Currently, [I'm a Software Engineer at Generate, working on Student Activity Calendar](https://github.com/GenerateNU/sac). My most recent project was oceanman, a toy PBR renderer made with wgpu and Rust; [you can read about it here](/oceanman-v0.4/).

I'm always looking to talk to new people or hear about a new opportunity, so feel free to reach out on [Github](https://github.com/michael-brennan2005) or through my [email](mailto:contact@tech0tron.net).
