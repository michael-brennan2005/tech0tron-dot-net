Welcome to my little slice of the internet, I'm Michael Brennan! (he/him)

I'm a freshman at Northeastern University, working on a computer science degree.

My most recent project was oceanman, a toy PBR renderer made with wgpu and Rust.

I'm always looking to talk to new people or hear about a new opportunity, so feel free to reach out on [Github](https://github.com/michael-brennan2005) or through my [email](mailto:contact@tech0tron.net).

[You can find my resume here](/resume.pdf).
