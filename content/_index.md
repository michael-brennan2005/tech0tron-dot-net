Welcome to my little slice of the internet!! My name is Michael Brennan! (he/him)

I'm a freshman at Northeastern University, and I'll be pursuing a degree in computer engineering.

My main interests are low-level and embedded systems, and GPU programming. This summer I've been working on oceanman, which aims to be a realistic PBR renderer made with wgpu and Rust.

I'm always looking to talk to new people or hear about a new opportunity, so feel free to reach out on [Github](https://github.com/tech0tron) or through my [email](mailto:contact@tech0tron.net).
