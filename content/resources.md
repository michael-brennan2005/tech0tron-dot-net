Useful/cool/englightening/interesting links I've found.

# General/Career
- [Z-Library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-Library) - Their link changes frequently so I go to the wikipedia page and use the URL that's on there. Absolutely essential tool when it comes to learning programming
- [Essays on programming that I think about a lot](https://www.benkuhn.net/progessays/)
- [Don't Call Yourself a Programmer, and Other Career Advice](https://www.kalzumeus.com/2011/10/28/dont-call-yourself-a-programmer/)
- [How to feel good](https://evanjconrad.com/posts/how-to-feel-good) - Basically an intro to cognitive behavioral therapy & meditation.
- [Xe laso's blog](https://xeiaso.net/)
- [Joel Spolsky's blog](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/)
- [Paul Graham's blog](http://www.paulgraham.com/index.html)
- [The Crossover Project](https://www.hillelwayne.com/post/are-we-really-engineers/) - Series about whether software engineers are "really" engineers.
- [Deep Learning from Scratch](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Learning-Scratch-Building-Principles/dp/1492041416) - Honestly this is here not as a resource but as a reminder for me to get around to reading this.
- [Scientist and Engineer's Guide to Digital Signal Processing](http://www.dspguide.com/) - Here for the same reason the Deep Learning From Scratch link is.
- [Spring visualization](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/rzvw27ljh9) - Very helpful for UI animation.
- [Susan Rigetti](https://www.susanrigetti.com/) - "So you want to learn..." series is cool (physics, math, philosophy).

# Computer Graphics
- [Real-Time Rendering](https://www.realtimerendering.com/) - The guidebook. Excellent for getting a lay of the land and figuring out what specific papers/technologies/techinques to look into. The book's bibliography alone is invaluable.
- [Graphics Programming Discord](https://graphics-programming.org/)
- [SIGGRAPH Advances in Real-Time Rendering](https://advances.realtimerendering.com/)
- [Learn OpenGL](https://learnopengl.com/) - Great tutorial series. Great companion to have with Real-Time Rendering for actually implementing features/techniques.
- [Learn WebGPU (C++)](https://eliemichel.github.io/LearnWebGPU/index.html) - Super in-depth tutorial for learning about WebGPU and computer graphics in general. I was able to use this tutorial and go straight to Rust's wgpu library too with very little friction.
- [Of Shaders and Triangles](https://blog.42yeah.is/)
- [Graphics Studies Compilation](http://www.adriancourreges.com/blog/2020/12/29/graphics-studies-compilation/) - Huuuge list of rendering breakdowns.
- [Kosmonaut's blog](https://kosmonautblog.wordpress.com/) - Doesn't look like they post anymore but still a treasure trove of posts. Their series on building a deferred renderer really helped me out with my renderer oceanman.
- [Physically Based Rendering in Filament](https://google.github.io/filament/Filament.html)
- [A Primer On Efficient Rendering Algorithms & Clustered Shading.](http://www.aortiz.me/2018/12/21/CG.html) - Overview of forward, deferred, tiled, forward+ & clustered shading.
- [Real Shading in Unreal Engine 4](https://blog.selfshadow.com/publications/s2013-shading-course/karis/s2013_pbs_epic_notes_v2.pdf) - Good for understanding image-based lighting and the split-sum approximation.
- [A Graphic Guy's Notes](https://agraphicsguynotes.com/) - Found their blog from their most recent post about understanding the math behind ReStir DI.
- [Matt Taylor's blog](https://64.github.io/) - Article of note is his one about tonemapping, which is how I was introduced to the problem.
- [Physically Based Rendering: From Theory to Implementation](https://www.pbr-book.org/)
- [Graphics Programming Weekly](https://www.jendrikillner.com/)
- [Carnegie Mellon's Computer Graphics course](http://15462.courses.cs.cmu.edu/spring2023/) - Great lecture slides.
